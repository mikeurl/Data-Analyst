# What Files Does the Installer Create?

## Overview

When you run `./setup.sh` or `python3 install.py`, here are **all the files and folders** that get created:

---

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. Virtual Environment Folder: `venv/`
**Size:** ~50-150 MB (depending on OS)
**Contains:** All Python packages isolated from your system Python

```
venv/
├── bin/           # Executables (python, pip, etc.)
├── lib/           # Installed packages (pandas, numpy, openai, gradio)
├── include/       # Header files
└── pyvenv.cfg     # Virtual environment config
```

**What this means:** Everything is self-contained in this folder. Delete it and nothing breaks on your system.

---

### 2. Environment Variables File: `.env`
**Size:** <1 KB
**Contains:** Your OpenAI API key

```
# OpenAI API Configuration
# Generated by installer on Linux

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

**Important:** This file is in `.gitignore` so it won't be committed to git!

---

### 3. Database File: `ipeds_data.db`
**Size:** ~1-2 MB
**Contains:** The entire SQLite database with all tables

This file includes:
- **students** table (~2,000 students)
- **enrollments** table (~8,500 enrollment records)
- **courses** table (10 courses)
- **course_enrollments** table (~30,000 course grades)
- **completions** table (~600 completions/graduations)

**What this means:** All your data is in this one file. You can:
- Copy it to share with others
- Open it with any SQLite browser
- Delete it to start fresh (just run `python SyntheticDataforSchema2.py` again)

---

### 4. (Optional) CSV Files
**Only created if you run `python generate_synthetic_data.py`**

- `synthetic_student_level_data.csv` - Student completion records in CSV format

**Only created if you run the anonymization tool:**
- `anonymized_data.csv` - Data with randomized student IDs
- `translation_table.csv` - Mapping to original IDs

---

## 🔍 What Does NOT Get Created

These files are already in the repository (you downloaded them):
- ✓ `install.py` - The installer script
- ✓ `setup.sh` / `setup.bat` - Quick launchers
- ✓ `create_ipeds_db_schema.py` - Database schema creator
- ✓ `SyntheticDataforSchema2.py` - Data generator
- ✓ `ai_sql_python_assistant.py` - AI assistant
- ✓ `requirements.txt` - List of packages to install
- ✓ All documentation files (.md files)

---

## 📊 Disk Space Used

After full installation:

| Item | Size |
|------|------|
| Virtual environment | 50-150 MB |
| Database file | 1-2 MB |
| Python packages (in venv) | 40-100 MB |
| **Total** | **~100-250 MB** |

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step File Creation

### When you run `./setup.sh`:

**Step 1:** Create virtual environment
```
venv/ folder appears
```

**Step 2:** Install dependencies
```
venv/lib/python3.XX/site-packages/ gets filled with:
  - pandas/
  - numpy/
  - openai/
  - gradio/
  - (and their dependencies)
```

**Step 3:** Configure API key
```
.env file is created (or updated)
```

**Step 4:** Create database schema
```
ipeds_data.db file appears (empty, ~20 KB)
```

**Step 5:** Generate sample data
```
ipeds_data.db grows to ~1-2 MB (now contains data)
```

## 🧪 How to Check What Was Created

### Check if virtual environment exists:
```bash
ls -la venv/
```
You should see: `bin/`, `lib/`, `include/`, `pyvenv.cfg`

### Check if database was created:
```bash
ls -lh ipeds_data.db
```
You should see: `-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1.2M Nov 6 12:34 ipeds_data.db`

### Check if database has data:
```bash
sqlite3 ipeds_data.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;"
```
You should see a number like: `2000`

### Check if packages were installed:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip list | grep -E "(pandas|numpy|openai|gradio)"
```
You should see all four packages listed.

## 🗑️ How to Start Fresh

### Delete everything the installer created:
```bash
rm -rf venv/
rm .env
rm ipeds_data.db
```

### Then reinstall:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

---

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Where is the database stored?
**A:** In `ipeds_data.db` in the project root folder.

### Q: Can I move the database file?
**A:** Yes! It's just a file. Copy it anywhere. The scripts look for it in the current folder though, so either:
- Keep it in the project folder, OR
- Edit the scripts to point to a different location

### Q: How do I back up my data?
**A:** Just copy `ipeds_data.db` to another location:
```bash
cp ipeds_data.db backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

### Q: Can I open the database in Excel?
**A:** Not directly. Use:
- **DB Browser for SQLite** (free GUI tool)
- **Export to CSV** with Python:
  ```python
  import sqlite3
  import pandas as pd
  conn = sqlite3.connect("ipeds_data.db")
  df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM students", conn)
  df.to_excel("students.xlsx", index=False)
  ```

### Q: Does the installer modify my system Python?
**A:** No! Everything is installed in the `venv/` folder. Your system Python is untouched.

### Q: Can I use my own OpenAI API key?
**A:** Yes! Either:
- Enter it when the installer asks, OR
- Edit `.env` file manually after installation

---

## 📝 Summary

**The installer creates:**
1. ✅ `venv/` folder with Python packages
2. ✅ `.env` file with your API key
3. ✅ `ipeds_data.db` database with sample data

**Total disk space:** ~100-250 MB
**Can be deleted:** Yes, everything is self-contained
**System Python affected:** No, uses virtual environment

---

**Bottom line:** The installer creates everything you need in the project folder. Nothing is installed globally, so it's safe and easy to remove.
